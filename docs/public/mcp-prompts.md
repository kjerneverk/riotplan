# MCP Prompts

Complete reference for all MCP workflow prompts available in RiotPlan. Prompts are pre-built workflow templates that guide you through common tasks.

## What are MCP Prompts?

MCP Prompts are workflow templates that provide step-by-step guidance for common RiotPlan tasks. They combine multiple tools and resources into cohesive workflows.

## Available Prompts

### explore_idea

Explore a new idea collaboratively without premature commitment. Capture thoughts, constraints, questions, and evidence.

**Use when:**
- Starting to explore a new concept
- Not ready to commit to a plan
- Want to gather context and constraints
- Need to document questions and uncertainties

**Arguments:**
- `code` (optional) - Idea identifier (kebab-case, e.g., "real-time-notifications")
- `description` (optional) - Initial concept description

**Workflow:**
1. Create idea directory structure
2. Capture initial concept
3. Add notes and observations
4. Document constraints
5. Raise questions
6. Attach evidence
7. Add narrative context
8. Decide: continue exploring, move to shaping, or kill

**Example:**

```typescript
// Start exploring an idea
explore_idea({
  code: "real-time-collab",
  description: "Add real-time collaboration features"
})
```

**What it does:**
- Creates IDEA.md with your concept
- Sets up .history/timeline.jsonl for tracking
- Guides you through exploration
- Helps capture all relevant context

### shape_approach

Compare different approaches and make decisions before building detailed plans. Surface tradeoffs and gather evidence.

**Use when:**
- Multiple ways to solve a problem
- Need to evaluate tradeoffs
- Want to gather team feedback
- Ready to move from idea to approach

**Arguments:**
- `path` (optional) - Path to idea or shaping directory

**Workflow:**
1. Review idea context
2. Propose approaches
3. Document tradeoffs for each
4. Gather feedback
5. Attach evidence
6. Compare approaches
7. Select best approach
8. Move to plan creation

**Example:**

```typescript
// Start shaping approaches
shape_approach({
  path: "./real-time-collab"
})
```

**What it does:**
- Creates SHAPING.md
- Guides approach documentation
- Facilitates comparison
- Helps make informed decisions

### create_plan

Create a new plan with AI-generated steps for a complex task (use after shaping).

**Use when:**
- Ready to commit to an approach
- Need detailed execution steps
- Want AI to generate actionable plan
- Have clear requirements

**Arguments:**
- `code` (optional) - Plan code/identifier (e.g., "auth-system", "dark-mode")
- `description` (optional) - Detailed description of what you want to accomplish
- `directory` (optional) - Parent directory where the plan should be created (e.g., "./plans")
- `steps` (optional) - Number of steps to generate (AI determines if not specified)

**Workflow:**
1. Gather requirements
2. Choose generation mode (analysis-first or direct)
3. Generate plan with AI
4. Review generated content
5. Validate structure
6. Begin execution

**Example:**

```typescript
// Create a plan
create_plan({
  code: "websocket-sync",
  description: "Implement WebSocket-based real-time sync",

- Guides conversational refinement
- Creates checkpoints automatically
- Tracks all changes
- Preserves full context

### execute_plan

Execute a plan with intelligent state management. Automatically determines next step, guides through tasks, and manages execution state.

**Use when:**
- Ready to start execution
- Want guided step-by-step workflow
- Need automatic status tracking
- Executing complex multi-step plan

**Arguments:**
- `path` (optional) - Path to the plan directory to execute

**Workflow:**
1. Check current status
2. Identify next step
3. Read step details
4. Execute tasks
5. Verify completion
6. Update status
7. Move to next step
8. Repeat until complete

**Example:**

```typescript
// Execute a plan
execute_plan({
  path: "./plans/websocket-sync"
})
```

**What it does:**
- Reads STATUS.md to find current state
- Guides through each step
- Updates status automatically
- Handles blockers and issues
- Tracks progress

### execute_step

Execute a single step from a plan with proper status tracking.

**Use when:**
- Working on specific step
- Not executing full plan
- Need focused guidance
- Want granular control

**Arguments:**
- `path` (optional) - Plan directory path

**Workflow:**
1. Check plan status

## Workflow Combinations

### Full Idea-to-Execution Flow

```typescript
// 1. Explore idea
explore_idea({
  code: "feature-x",
  description: "New feature concept"
})

// 2. Shape approach
shape_approach({
  path: "./feature-x"
})

// 3. Create plan
create_plan({
  code: "feature-x-impl",
  description: "Implement feature X using approach A"
})

// 4. Refine plan
develop_plan({
  path: "./plans/feature-x-impl"
})

// 5. Execute plan
execute_plan({
  path: "./plans/feature-x-impl"
})

// 6. Track progress
track_progress({
  path: "./plans/feature-x-impl"
})
```

### Quick Plan Execution

```typescript
// 1. Create plan directly
create_plan({
  code: "quick-fix",
  description: "Fix bug in authentication"
})

// 2. Execute plan
execute_plan({
  path: "./plans/quick-fix"
})
```

### Iterative Development

```typescript
// 1. Create initial plan
create_plan({
  code: "feature-y",
  description: "Implement feature Y"
})

// 2. Refine based on feedback
develop_plan({
  path: "./plans/feature-y"
})

// 3. Execute step by step
execute_step({
  path: "./plans/feature-y"
})

// 4. Track progress regularly
track_progress({
  path: "./plans/feature-y"
})
```

## Tips

### When to Use Prompts

- **Starting out** - Use prompts to learn the workflow
- **Complex tasks** - Let prompts guide you through steps
- **Collaboration** - Prompts provide shared process
- **Consistency** - Prompts ensure nothing is missed

### When to Use Tools Directly

- **Experienced users** - Skip prompts for speed
- **Simple tasks** - Tools may be more direct
- **Custom workflows** - Build your own process
- **Automation** - Scripts use tools, not prompts

### Combining Prompts and Tools

You can mix prompts and direct tool calls:

```typescript
// Start with prompt
explore_idea({ code: "idea-x" })

// Use tools directly for specific actions
riotplan_idea_add_note({ note: "Important insight" })
riotplan_idea_add_evidence({ 
  evidencePath: "./mockup.png",
  description: "UI mockup"
})

// Return to prompt for next phase
shape_approach({ path: "./idea-x" })
```
